FDM Churn Prediction




📋 Project Overview

FDM Churn Prediction is a data science project aimed at predicting customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the loss of clients or customers, is a critical metric for many industries. This project leverages feature-driven modeling (FDM) to enhance prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.
