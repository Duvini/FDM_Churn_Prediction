## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**FDM Churn Prediction** is a data science project aimed at predicting customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the loss of clients or customers, is a critical metric for many industries. This project leverages feature-driven modeling (FDM) to enhance prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw data for optimal model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement and compare multiple models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations**: Gain insights through data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python (3.8+)
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - XGBoost
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding
  - Git for version control
